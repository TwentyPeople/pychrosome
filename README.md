# Pychrosome #

Pychrosome is a scientific Python set of genetics models and tools. It focuses on two main objectives:

* Provide an OOP model of genetics: genotype, chromosomes, genes...
* Render a genotype given two parent genotypes, applying Mendel's Laws and other genetics concepts.

It's a work in progress that will probably be used alongside a college research on Huntington's Disease.
